# Contributing to astro-gov-starter

Thank you for helping improve this template. Contributions that benefit the
broader government web community are especially welcome.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ctrimm/astro-gov-starter.git
cd astro-gov-starter
pnpm install        # installs all dependencies
pnpm dev            # starts dev server at http://localhost:4321
```

`pnpm dev` and `pnpm build` automatically copy USWDS fonts, images, and JS
from `node_modules` to `public/uswds/`. You don't need to run anything extra.

---

## Local quality gates

Run all checks before opening a PR:

```bash
bash scripts/check.sh          # TypeScript + build + plain-language + compliance + HTML validate
bash scripts/check.sh --verbose # same, with per-file output
```

Individual checks:

```bash
pnpm check                              # TypeScript only
pnpm build                              # full build
npx html-validate 'dist/**/*.html'      # HTML validation
node scripts/plain-language.mjs         # readability (avg FK grade ≤ 8)
node scripts/compliance-check.mjs       # USWDS banner/identifier/skip-nav
```

Accessibility and Lighthouse are run only in CI (they need a browser).
To test locally, run `pnpm preview` then:

```bash
npx @axe-core/cli http://localhost:4321/
```

## Adding a USWDS component wrapper

1. Check [designsystem.digital.gov/components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/)
   for the canonical USWDS markup.
2. Create `src/components/uswds/ComponentName.astro`.
3. Use `Astro.props` for any configurable parts; use `<slot />` for content.
4. Do not recreate USWDS behaviour in JavaScript — rely on the USWDS JS bundle
   already loaded in `BaseLayout.astro`.
5. Add the component to the preview page at `src/pages/internal/components.astro`.

---

## Adding a content collection

1. Add your schema to `src/content.config.ts` using the `glob()` loader.
2. Create `src/content/<collection-name>/` with at least one `.md` file.
3. Add the corresponding page(s) in `src/pages/` (and `src/pages/es/` for Spanish).
4. Export the new collection from `collections` in `src/content.config.ts`.

---

## i18n guidelines

- English is the primary locale (pages live at `/`).
- Spanish is the mirrored locale (pages live at `/es/`).
- All user-visible strings belong in `src/i18n/translations/en.ts` and `es.ts`.
- Pages in `src/pages/es/` should mirror their English counterparts structurally.
- Content that differs substantively between locales (e.g., program names that
  don't translate) can stay hardcoded in the page file.

---

## Accessibility requirements

All contributions must maintain **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance:

- Every image needs meaningful `alt` text (or `alt=""` if decorative).
- Every form input needs a visible `<label>` associated by `for`/`id` or `aria-label`.
- Interactive elements must be keyboard-operable and have visible focus indicators.
- Color contrast: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components.
- Dynamic content changes must be announced to screen readers via ARIA live regions.
- Do not suppress focus styles.

The CI `a11y` job runs axe-core against key pages on every push. Zero violations
is the threshold — PRs that introduce violations will not be merged.

## Commit messages

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
feat(component): add Table wrapper with sortable column support
fix(ci): correct axe-core server startup timing
docs: update quick-start instructions for Cloud.gov Pages
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `chore`.

## Opening a pull request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and run `bash scripts/check.sh`.
3. Fill out the pull request template completely.
4. Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting review.

PRs that add new components or page templates should include a screenshot or
screen recording showing the component in the preview page (`/internal/components/`).

---

## Scope policy

This is a **starter template**, not an application framework. We accept:

- Thin USWDS component wrappers
- Generic page templates applicable to most government service sites
- CI gate improvements
- Documentation improvements
- Dependency updates

We generally decline:

- Application-specific logic (form backends, authentication, databases)
- Components that reimplment USWDS behaviour in Astro/JavaScript
- Features applicable only to one agency or program type

If you're unsure, open an issue first to discuss before implementing.
